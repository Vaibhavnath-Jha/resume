					{\textbf{Master Thesis: Human Choice Behavior in Car Driving}
					\begin{itemize}
					    \item Primary Objective: Estimate adequate behavioral choice models in order to understand the decision-making process while driving a car
					    \item Secondary Objective: Scrap the web for in-drive choice date
					    \item Several \textbf{Multinomial Logit} models, based on the utility maximization theory, were estimated using the Apollo package for \textbf{R} to capture the underlying choice behavior

					{\textbf{Lot sizing for injection moulding machines at BMW Group}
					\begin{itemize}
					    \item Primary Objective: Minimization of set up and inventory costs 
					    \item Secondary Objective: Creating a cost-effective schedule
					    \item A \textbf{Mixed integer mathematical model} was researched and later Tabu Search heuristic was used in order to optimize the associated costs.
					    \item The mathematical model and Tabu Search heuristic were developed on \textbf{Python}, using its linear programming library, \textbf{PuLP}

					{\textbf{Employee Satisfaction}
					\begin{itemize}
					    \item Primary Objective: To determine level of satisfaction of employees in a consultancy with the use of a well-researched \textbf{Questionnaire} and later using \textbf{Exploratory Factor Analysis}.
					    \item Secondary Objective: 
					        \begin{enumerate}
					            \item To know employee’s opinion about work place, pay and benefits
					            \item Study and analyses the various factors affecting the job satisfaction level
					        \end{enumerate}
